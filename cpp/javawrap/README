Instruction how to use java wrappers for Polem.

After standard install process ( cmake.. && make && sudo make install ) PolemJava.jar file is produced. Jar file needs to be included in the project as it provides Java API. Besides including jar file, we need to add java polem library path to java.library.path in JVM. It can be done by providing such flag to JVM : ' -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib/ '. Library resides in /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib and was installed during installation process. After aforementioned, we need to load libary from path provided to JVM with System.loadLibrary("PolemJava") (it loads libPolemJava.so from /usr/local/lib). There is simple main.java file showing the use of Polem. 

Summarizing, to use java wrappers : 

1. Include Jar file produced while building in project.

2. Provide ' -Djava.library.path=/path/to/lib/ ' flag to JVM, path is usually /usr/lib/ or /usr/local/lib/

3. Load library in code with System.loadLibrary("PolemJava")
